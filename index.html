      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I’m currently a student at Cornell University pursuing Information Science with concentrations in User
        Experience and Data Science. More than anything, I’ve always loved creating. I picked up my first camera, a
        camcorder, when I was ten years old. Documenting everything I encountered, I didn’t know that what I would do
        in
        the future would be a manifestation of all my creative facets. Although I preferred to be behind the camera,
        my
        little corner in which I shared from was through mediums other than words. It was through a lens. A drawing.
        As
        I grew up and was finding my footing in my career, I lost touch with my hobbies and what I truly enjoyed doing
        —
        making life easier for others, as it was made easier for me when I picked up my first camcorder as a shy,
        afraid-to-speak kid. I discovered that the intersection between technology and sharing is where I belong. My
        values in the arts and problem solving aligned perfectly with creating experiences for users through design,
        and
        it was a medium in which both my skillset and interests crossed paths.
