    <h3>
      GCal Concept: Making Planning Events Easier
    </h3>
  </div>

  <div class=case-study-block>
    <p>
      Ever since I got to university, whenever I was in a group and plans were being made, I heard “Send me a GCal
      invite.” At first, I didn’t even know GCal was short for Google Calendar, which I was familiar enough with to
      schedule events for my own personal use. But the first time I agreed to plans and my friends said, “Send over a
      GCal invite,” I was surprised. How did GCal, which was once something that was so formal for me, become something
      my friends and I depended on for Sunday brunch?
    </p>
    <h4>
      Appreciating GCal Invites
    </h4>
    <p>
      The more I received GCal invites, however, the more I was urged to send them. Whether they were target runs,
      picnics on the slope, or even a short study session, I wanted to know whether or not plans were concrete and/or
      how seriously we would go through with them. Therefore, when I discovered invites, I was excited.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Understanding Why People Don’t Respond to Invites
    </h4>
    <p>
      I enjoyed the fact that people could respond to plans, so organizers could see who could attend and who couldn’t.
      One thing I noticed, however, was that even if a GCal was sent weeks in advance, some people never responded.
      There
      is an RSVP option, where guests can respond to GCal invites with “Yes,” “No,” or “Maybe,” but nothing was truly
      prompting them to respond besides an email when the invite was initially sent out (if the organizer chose to
      notify
      through email). Another thing I noticed was that many times, GCal invites are sent hastily just as a reminder, so
      when the day actually approaches, people realize they cannot make it anymore. If only there was a way to formalize
      best matching everyone’s availabilities.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Research — How others agree to plans
    </h4>
    <p>
      After asking others (mostly GCal users) how they usually settle on a day for an event, a lot of people said
      When2Meet or Calendly if they could not formalize plans on the spot (which is most of the time). iMessage polls
      were
      even a hot option, but complaints came with it- such as the fact that it was hard to keep track of, authentication
      (keeping track of who is voting what) is a hassle, and difficult to reference in the future.
      But Google Calendar is a consistent medium amongst all these users, which meant that if there was a means to
      “vote”
      on a time within the interface itself, it would skip a lot of steps in the scheduling timeline. That is where the
      idea of an integrated, collaborative scheduling platform came into play.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Figuring Out The Feature
    </h4>
    <p>
      What works right now for people? What is the “go-to” method for finding a time that works for everyone, whether it
      be for regular weekly meetings or a large one-time event? Usually, it goes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Send out a When2Meet with dates within the appropriate time frame.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wait for guests to fill out When2Meet.
      </li>
      <li>
        See which time works for the most people.
      </li>
      <li>
        Send out a Google Calendar invite for a meeting.
      </li>
      <li>
        Check for RSVPs.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      Figuring Out What Feature Spaces to Improve
    </h4>
    <p>
      The problem that seemed to be persistent while we were brainstorming was that guests, especially when invited in a
      larger group, are not motivated to respond as soon as possible. The pressure to respond is lessened even more when
      there is a long list of attendees to respond. There are times organizers make it a point for their guests to
      accept
      invites and rely on them heavily for attendance, but it is not concrete.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Motivating People to Use the Feature
    </h4>
    <p>
      So how can we motivate people to respond to Google Calendar invites? My initial thought was to make it interactive
      and all-in-one for guests, where they could get the potential times, fill out their availabilities, and accept
      invites all in one place. Additionally, I realized that When2Meet enforces people to fill it out by allowing
      organizers (and other guests) to see who responded and who hasn’t. Therefore, adding the feature into the invite
      sounded like a good initiative.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Hashing Out Ideas
    </h4>
    <h5>
      Initial Approach
    </h5>
    <p>
      My first approach was to include a feature when creating the event called “Submitting Availability,” making it
      optional for organizers if they would like to spend the extra time seeing everyone’s availabilities. From opening
      this feature, a pop-up would allow organizers to choose a time period, and as guests filled it out, the suggested
      times would be updated. However, there were a few issues with this approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Firstly, it's a lot of steps. It’s easy to get lost in the process if the organizer already has to set up other
      details for the event (i.e., location, video conferencing, etc.). Additionally, my first flow contained similar
      aesthetics as When2Meet, which felt out of place with Google Calendar’s themes. So, I thought of ways that I could
      make the entire new feature more consistent with Google Calendar.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Matching the Google Calendar Mission
    </h4>
    <p>
      After receiving feedback from my critique group, the first thing I strove to change was the look of the feature,
      starting from the color itself. I changed it from green to Google Calendar’s classic blue. I then made the
      interactive portion so that guests can see their schedule and drag within it- making the process less steps
      overall.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Final Interaction for Event Scheduling
    </h4>
    <p>
      The final flow includes a simplistic drag-and-submit feature, incorporating the Google Calendar main view as the
      basis for the feature. This way, there is minimal change, and what people love about Google Calendar- its
      simplicity, ease of use, and design- remains intact.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Conclusion
    </h4>
    <p>
      Even with a universally well-used app within the college community such as Google Calendar, there is always room
      for
      improvement. Since I first began this feature implementation at the beginning of the semester, Google Calendar has
      become even more normalized. With more users comes more room for improvement, and I hope that people sharing their
      opinions on user experience shapes it into something ideal for planning, organization, and sharing.
